* A simple, open-ended 3D platformer with collectibles, enemies, and many levels. My first major Godot game, runs on Godot 4.4

* NOTE: certain assets, like the music, trees, and many 3D models, are licensed from outside sources. You may need to remove these if you make your own version.
* If you have any questions about certain assets, ask me. I am planning on adding a list of licensed files and their sources in the future.
* Any assets that ARE made by me fall under the aformentioned license. This gets foggy with some assets like the skyboxes, and I don't know how the licenses apply there.
